# ALX Listing App

The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint.

## Project Structure

- **components/**

The _components/_ folder is where reusable UI building blocksâ€”like buttons, cards, modals, headers, footers, etc. are stored.
This is helpful to avoid repeating code in multiple pages.

- **interfaces/**

The _interfaces/_ folder contains TypeScript interfaces that define the structure of props, data models, API responses, etc.
This is helpful because it:
Centralized typing, Easy to locate and update interface definitions etc

- **constants/**

The constants/ folder is used to store reusable constant values like:
Configuration variables, Static data, URL endpoints, Text labels etc

- **public/assets**

This folder is part of the public/ directory, which is a special Next.js directory for storing static assets like Images (.png, .jpg, .svg), Fonts, Icons, Videos
